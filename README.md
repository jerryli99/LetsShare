# LetsShare
My first Experimental Qt C++ GUI App for Windows 11 x86 64

This is a quick and simple LAN file transfer app. I was going to use AES and RSA for file encryption, but then I decided to leave it like this without encryption. This app assumes you are in your home network, trying to transfer files (with no connection cables) but got annoyed because you have to upload to the cloud or chat apps and then download the files to your other computer. With this app, you can transfer whatever size file you want to your other computer, so no file size limit. This app is not perfect, but it solves my issue. Let's see if I will update this app in the future. Good Luck.
